It exists for several purposes:\n\n1) to create a more REST-like interface for the mongoose model methods\n2) to insulate all of the mongoose model methods from your particular model class to reduce collision.\n3) to bundle a set of features with all models.\n\nNote that in hive-model-mongoose, the assumption is that the models functions, not the records' native functions,\nare called.\n\nNote that though Mongooose_Model is a model , the only part of hive-model that is used is the dataspace,\nwhich like Mongoose is also injected.\n\nInjected Mongoose\n-----------------\nOne important caveat is that mongoose is NOT bundled with this module. For consistency's sake mongoose is injected\ninto the configuration of each model's configuration.\n\nThis is because the database configuration is embedded into the definition of the mongoose model and is therefore\nbetter assigned to an injected instance of that module than put into this module.\n\nAdded Functionality\n-------------------\n\nAll models have \"soft deletion\" built in to the delete method. if Model.delete(record, callback, true) is called,\nthe models' delete flag is set to true, but the record itself is preserved.\n\n",
